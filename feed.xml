            <description>I have an old LG Blu-ray Player laying around, it's the BP450 model and it supports some streaming apps, but it's limited to Netflix and YouTube and there's no App Store, so can I mod it to load third party stuff?</description>

            <description>In the last post I described how WhatsApp is bad and suggested to use RCS instead. And while it is true that RCS is really cool, it has many problems and a lot of them exist just because we don't consider it enough in the modern days of instant messaging apps.</description>
